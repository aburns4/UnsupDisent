# Unsupervised Disentanglement without Autoencoding
Repository for paper "Unsupervised Disentanglement without Autoencoding: Pitfalls and Future Directions" featured at the [ICML 2021 Workshop Self-Supervised Learning for Reasoning and Perception](https://icml21ssl.github.io/index.html). Paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06613), as well as our workshop poster [here](https://icml21ssl.github.io/pages/files/icml_disentanglement_poster.pdf).

We provide the colab used to generate the MNIST/STL-10 dataset used for all our disentanglement experiments and the resulting data files for use by others.

If you make use of the paper or the MNIST/STL-10 data, please cite our paper:
